Welcome! This is an overview of all the plans for the two-week sprints I worked thorugh during this semester. Another column has been added for a small evaluation on the completion of the goals.

## Week 21
| Goal | How do I plan to do it?  | When has it been achieved? |
| :----------- | :---------------- | :------- |
| Make the body appear in the game. | Hopla | When you can see the body in the game. |
| Zone for hands. | Tutorial about how to do it. | When it works. |
| (MAYBE ANIMATIONS FOR THE BODY - BLENDER VS. UNITY) |  |  |

## Week 19 and 20
| Goal | How do I plan to do it?  | When has it been achieved? |

## Week 15 and 16
| Goal | How do I plan to do it?  | When has it been achieved? |
| :----------- | :---------------- | :------- |
| Understand how to animate simple models in blender, both as the whole model itself and making joints for a character model, and animating movement. |  |  |
| Understand how to animate models in Unity |  |  |
| Understand the differences, advantages and disadvantages by making animations in Blender and Unity. |  |  |

## Week 12 and 13
| Goal | How do I plan to do it?  | When has it been achieved? |
| :----------- | :---------------- | :------- |


## Week 10 and 11

| :----------- | :---------------- | :------- |

## Week 8 and 9
| Goal | How do I plan to do it?  | When has it been achieved? | Evaluation |  |
| :----------- | :---------------- | :------- | :------ | :-------: |
| Understand how to make a 3D environment in Unity, and to make a character move around in it. | My plan is to continue and hopfully finish the written tutorial on Unity's own webpage. | When I have made a Unity project with a moving character.  | *I wanted to go step by step, and was very keen on learning how to use the Unity Editor a little bit at a time. During this sprint however, I got caught up in learning in what way I learn the best, and unfortunately this took up all my time. So by the end of the sprint I couldn't see a reason to keep waiting to start on the real project from our product owner. It also didn't help that I haven't defined a clear enough goal to learn for this sprint (the written tutorial was very long and didn't feel like I needed it) so sadly I had to adjust.* | ❌ |
| Understand how to implement a 3D model from Blender, and to be able to interact with it. | My plan is to to finish the donut tutorial and by that get a better understanding of how to do it. | When I have finished the donut tutorial and implemented the donut as an interactive object with a moving character in Unity. | *A lot of the same as the above. Spend too much time on learning how to acquire new knowledge, and at the same time wanted to learn too many new things, so I didn't know what direction to go in.* | ❌ |

## Week 6 and 7
| Goal | How do I plan to do it?  | When has it been achieved? | Evaluation |  |
| :----------- | :---------------- | :------- | :-------- | :-------: |
| Understand how to navigate and understand the fundamental elements in Unity. | Create a project from a template, and edit the properties to understand the way Unity works. In addition, go through the tutorial I found for the first day. | When I can create and operate objects and elements in Unity. | *The goal was comleted. Throughout these two weeks I have been working on a 2D Platform game in Unity with my teammate, and through that experience I learned scripting, inserting and manipulating objects and the interaction with the elements all together.* | ✔️ |
| Understand the fundamental elements in Blender. | Create and design models with Blender to use within the game from Unity, by using the tutorial for making a donut in Blender. | When it's possible to make a satisfying donut in Blender and implement this model in the Unity game. | *This goal was almost completed. I had to alternate the plans slightly since I wanted to finish the 2D Platform mini project. Instead I made another tutorial with modeling a simple character and in that I got the chance to put my new modeling skills from the donut tutorial to good use.* | ❌ |
