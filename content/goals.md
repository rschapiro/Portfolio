<!-- - Modeling and Sculpting workspace -->
<!-- - Shading - flat and smooth -->

<!-- -	Tools
    - Grab
    - Rotate
    - Scale
    - Extrude
    - Bevel
    - Inset -->
<!-- -	Animation -->
<!-- - Keyframe -->
<!-- - Graph editor -->


### Knowledge
*"I have knowledge about..."*

- the fundamentals of Blender and how to navigate it
- the different kinds of render engines when rendering pictures in Blender, amongst Eevee and Cycles
- the shading options: flat and smooth
- the object mode and the edit mode of Blender

### Skills
*"I am able to..."*

- design simple 3D models in Blender by using meshes and vertices
- design and build 3D models in Blender using the simple build-in tools, amongst grab, rotate, scale, extrude, bevel and inset
- create simple animations using keyframes and the graph editor


### Competences
*"I am able to..."*

- evaluate the functionality of different modifiers, amongst Subdivision, Mirror and Solidify
- evaluate the tools used in the modeling and the editing stage, and when to transission from one to another
- Blender workspace (modeling and sculpting)


## VR in Unity

<!-- -	Opsætning af projekt fra skabelon
    - Opsætning til “Build and run” til Oculus headset – android build -->
<!-- -	Opsætning til Git-repository -->
<!-- -	Motion sickness i VR
    - Bevægelse og principper at overveje for at mindske motion sickness -->
<!-- -	Indsætte erstatning for controllere (hænder i stedet for controllere) -->
<!-- -	Grabbing/pinching animation -->
<!-- -	Scripts i Unity -->
<!-- -	Indsætning af assets – objects/img-filer -->
<!-- -	Tilføje og lave materials til objects -->
<!-- -	Components til objects -->
<!-- -   XRRig -->
<!-- -   custom hand poses (when grabbing objects) -->

<!-- [STRANGE SENTENCE] -->


<!-- - the uses of scripts, how to write them as well as which to add and to which -->


### Knowledge
*"I have knowledge about..."*

- the fundamentals of the Unity Editor and how to navigate it
- the package manager and the asset store and how to use it
- set up a project for "build and run" for the Meta Quest 2 headset

### Skills
*"I am able to..."*

- create simple 2D and 3D/VR projects using templates
- change the color as well as the look of the controllers
- make animations run and control them when triggered by controller inputs
- design custom hand poses for grabbing different 3D objects in a Unity project
- write my own scripts from the ground up
- use the animator together with animations imported from Blender, to trigger animations and change animation states

### Competences
*"I am able to..."*

- evaluate how to mitigate the feeling of motion sickness while in a virtual environment
- evaluate the uses of components for 3D-objects in Unity
- evaluate the difference between working in a 2D and a 3D project
