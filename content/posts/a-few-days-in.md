## A Few Days In
Hi there! So now...phew. Bit of a rough start. It's been mostly very exciting and I feel we've gotten a good idea of how this semester is gonna go. We've finished the introductory days, and are now starting to work by ourselves. Today we sat and started to research on our subjects and tried to make some progress.

### What I did today:

**Wrote a plan for goals to hit for the upcoming two weeks:**
I made a table on one of my pages that shows how what I will be working towards for the first two weeks. This is currently not in the right locaion, but will update it soon. It's now residing in this blog post [this blog post](https://schapiro.tech/posts/first-day-back/#table) ðŸ˜Ž

Next up I installed Unity and started reading and going through the tutorial for getting started on [Unity's websit](https://learn.unity.com/mission/real-time-creation-essentials). This went fairly well. I spent some time with Alexander to figure out how to collaborate on projects while working in Unity as well. This was a bit more tricky, and we still need to look into that. Tried with Git Bash and a remote rpository on GitHub, but turned out to be a little more complicated than we thought.

The last thing for today was that I started working on a LEGO Microgame Tutorial from Unity's website. The tutorial was a little difficult to find, since the tutorial on the website was a little outdated, but managed to find it in the end, through a template in the Unity Editor. I only managed to get through a little bit, but this Microgame tutorial was very fun and engaging, and I'm really excited to dig more in and learn more about this one ðŸ’»
