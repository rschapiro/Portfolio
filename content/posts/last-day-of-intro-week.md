## Alrighty then!
Today was the last day on the first introductory week. The mood is good.

Today we continued working on how to collaborate on projects in Unity. It was a bit more dofficult than I assumed, but I sent request to get a Student Plan in order to work with Plastic SCM for free (hopefully). There are quite a few benefits as a student üòé

After that we contacted our product owner for our project. Will be nice to meet him and looking forward to work with him. Then I have been learning about Blender today.

This was really fun and exciting. A lot of cool tools, and a very elaborate piece of software I must say. I've been putting together a small document where I talk a bit more in detail of what I learned. I'm making a donut. So far it looks like this:

I'm quite happy about the result so far and looking forward to continue working on it. The document with more details on my learning from this first day with Blender will be posted soon. I also need to organize my portfolio a bit more. It will come. Bit by bit. Day by day. I will go now and enjoy my weekend üèñÔ∏è
(Not exactly the time to go on the beach, but you know...)
