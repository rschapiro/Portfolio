Here we are. First selfmade model made in Blender. This was after the idea of Alex. He suggested it could be good to have something for me to be able to pick up in VR tomorrow, since the plan is to be working on VR tomorrow. I used a reference picture just like Andrew the Blender Guru suggests in the Donut tutorial.

I made the dumbbell from three cylinders that I stretched and formed in different ways to form the dumbbell. I made sure to scale it down, so it hopefully will be in a size that makes sense for using it in VR.

This is the final one with color choice after rendering:

It was really nice to try and make something in Blender today, it gave some encouragement. Looking forward to try and use it tomorrow in a VR environment.
