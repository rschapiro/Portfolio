So this is a small text describing what has happened lately. It's been a bit rough I'm afraid. Have been trying to take on too much at the same time, so it could have been better. I just had a talk with Simon after our project meeting. He was very supportive and tried to explain to me that I need to take one thing at a time, and complete the course or book, or what I've been trying to work on, fully before moving on to something else. Use the course (or book - chapter by chapter) to create a structure for my learning, and for the procedure in which I will learn different things. 

"What if stuff is outdated then?" "That's just a part of being a teacher." But nevertheless I can use that as means of learning how to figure out how to learn these things in a new way.

I think overall if I take one thing at a time (course or something similar) I can slowly build upon what I know about that specific subject I'm learning about. Even in Blender I will be able to build knowledge on how to use different filters, and which kind of texture to use where and how to model and design different things. The whole thing about learning how to use the different tools in Blender, is also going to make me learn more, and make me able to document my learning in this subject. E.g. if I try animating in Blender and afterwards doing it in Unity, I will be able to build competence and evaluate whether animating using one software over the other is worth it.

Another thing is also during the courses they might come up with mini projects that I could be working on (otherwise I can try and come up with my own) based on the skills just learned through a chapter.

I shouldn't go too crazy. Bit by bit.
