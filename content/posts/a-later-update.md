# General stuff
Hello again, bloggen! It's been a while. Last week got a bit overwhelming. I started up a small 2D platformer project with Alex and i wanted to finish my Blender Donut tutorial so that I would be able to make sprites for the game. Unofrtunately this took more time than expected, so we had to shift plans slightly.

Instead during this week I put the Donut project on hold, and started working on the character model for the player you would be using in the game.

I started yesterday and I was very glad I had a little bit of practice with the donut beforehand. I finished the character model today, and tomorrow I will change the colors slightly on the clothing to make the enemy character for the game as well.

This is the final product of the character model:

I will make an article explaining the work process for this character model in a few days hopefully.

## Other things this week
This week I also started having meetings. The others from my group started last week. I can imagine them being very helpful later on. This morning it was only Alex and I for the first meeting. Jakob helped a lot defining my to subjects for the semester, and I will have a talk with Allan about it soon, to make a better understanding and definition about the subjects.

For now that's it I think. I hope I can get back to make updates on my blog more regularly. See you for now!
