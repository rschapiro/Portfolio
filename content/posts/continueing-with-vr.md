Today I wanted to fidure out if there was a way for me to test the applications I make directly on the headset itself. But this turned out to be a bit more problematic than I thought.

So apparently I had to download the Oculus Integration asset from the Asset Store in Unity. It was nice that it was free to download.

And then downloading it as well through the Window > Package Manager on the menu in Unity.

Then I was importing the files for the Oculus Integration and a lot uf pop-up windows appeared:

Luckily I can read about the release notes for the latest updates if I so please [here](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/unity-integration/) (also added to the reference list).

I have a bit of a headache now. It struck me out a bit. Earlier today I went to a meeting where we discussed motivation and how to re-ignite it if it has disappeared. It was quite interesting and I find that if I try to work on my blog so I will get used to it every day, it will help a bit more. Maybe I need to practice staying at school until 16:00. I think staying until 15:00 or 15:30 is pretty alright.
