First up today were the two meetings for groups with same subjects as me. Once again we were the only two for the first meeting. It's starting to get a little dull I must say. I hope the others will turn up soon as well.

Then, something great happened. I tried another tutorial for running the VR application directly on the headset and I can only say: Yes sir! It finally works!

If I just press the 'Build And Run'-button the app imediately runs from the headset and there it has no lag at all! Then I can just stream the experience to my phone or something if I want to show it to other people. Awesome!

For the rest of the day I tried to find out if I knew how to start a VR experience from a template and make it work, and it seems like that works as well. Feeling good about this!
