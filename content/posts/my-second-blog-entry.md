## Interesting things
Hello again! Here I am again writing about things. We've found a company for colaborating with the project, and that is just swell. Looking forward to getting it validated and starting to work on it.

Some extra stuff!

## Some new commands!
In Visual Studio Code, my friend taught me some new commands:

Firstly,
```terminal
hugo new posts/my-second-blog.md
```
which automatically makes a new blog post, and creates it with the timestamp of my own computer. That way I don't have to do it myself üòè

The other one makes me able to run the website locally, and in that way I am able to save the file and imediately see the change in the browser.

```terminal
hugo server
```

That's great!
